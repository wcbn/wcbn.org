We broadcast at 88.3 FM to the University and its surrounding communities from the Basement of the Student Activities Building in downtown Treetown. We are governed by our <a href=\"https://docs.wcbn.org/constitution/contents\">Constitution</a>. <br><br> Our emphasis is on alternative broadcasting, that is, exposing our listenership to things they can't hear on other radio stations. Our Program Guide is published once a semester; sometimes as a poster and sometimes as a 16 or 24-page booklet. For more information about what we play, check out our Programming Department. <br><br> We have some history of the Network available on-line -- we've been around for over 50 years in one form or another, so our history is quite extensive. <br><br> <strong>About This Site </strong><br>Our website was born soon after the first Mosaic was released. Since then, it has gone through lots of revisions. The current site was designed by me.
